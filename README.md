#### Please note that data is not attached in this as I was not able to upload due to size constraints. 

### To Run the project.

#### Open files_join_gait.ipynb to run gait analysis on gait_mostly_main.ipynb (contains main code). files_join_gait.ipynb helps running csv files of all the patients for analysis on main file gait_mostly_main.ipynb.

#### Similarly, open files_join_tremor.ipynb for tremor detection on file tremor_detection.ipynb (contains main code). files_join_tremor.ipynb helps running csv files of all the patients for analysis on main file tremor_detection.ipynb.
